## üöÄ My Projects:

### [Decoding Market Movements: Big Data Insights from News and Social Media](https://github.com/divyanshdeshmukh/Decoding-Market-Movements-Big-Data-Insights-from-News-and-Social-Media)
Decoding Market Movements is a big data project using Apache Spark and NLP to analyze financial news and stock trends. It employs LLMs for sentiment analysis, TF-IDF for keyword extraction, and Pearson correlation to assess market impact. Findings show sentiment influences stocks but is one of many factors. 

### [3D Visualization of California's Road Network](https://github.com/divyanshdeshmukh/3D-Visualization-of-California-s-Road-Network)
Using Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks to process and visualize 3D road data on Google Earth.

### [Cloud Serverless Minimizing Cold Start Time](https://github.com/divyanshdeshmukh/Cloud-Serverless-Fast-Start-Minimizing-Cold-Start-Time)
Reduced startup time on GCP through image caching and Kubernetes optimizations.

### [Parallel K-NN Graph Construction for High-Dimensional Spatial Data](https://github.com/divyanshdeshmukh/KDtree)
Developed a function in C++ using ParlayLib to construct KNN graphs for real-world datasets with millions of
points, producing binary-formatted outputs for clustering and geospatial visualization.

### [Social Media for Developers](https://github.com/divyanshdeshmukh/devconnector)
Developed a social media networking site for developers using MERN stack to connect and share ideas.

### [Feature-Selection-with-Nearest-Neighbour](https://github.com/divyanshdeshmukh/Feature-Selection-with-Nearest-Neighbour)
In this project, we were tasked with implementing feature selection algorithms, specifically Forward Selection and Backward Elimination, to analyze a given dataset and identify the most significant features that contribute to accurate classification.
